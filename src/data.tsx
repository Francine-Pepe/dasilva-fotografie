    text: "I am Francine, a Web Developer and self-taught Photographer.\nPhotography became part of my life since I moved to Hamburg, Germany. It helped me through a very difficult time - when I lost my father. He loved photography! The first camera I used belonged to him - a Canon 450D. Naturally, I still have it, but I have decided to keep it very well guarded and safe. It has been used to record many, many beautiful moments, so I would love to keep it very well preserved. At the moment, my faithful companion is a Canon 250D, and a diverse kit of lenses. Here's a bit of my work and my photographic vision."
